INTEGRATION TEST — Category: {props.categoryId} ({props.categoryName})

Your job is to make progress setting up and running integration/E2E tests for **{props.categoryName}**.

This is INCREMENTAL work — you are NOT expected to make everything pass.
You ARE expected to:
1. Try to get as far as you can
2. Clearly document what's blocking further progress
3. Suggest tickets that would unblock testing

## Previous Findings

Read `{props.findingsFile}` if it exists — pick up where the last iteration left off.
If the file doesn't exist yet, you'll create it.

## Test Approach for this Category

{props.suites && props.suites.length > 0
  ? props.suites.map(s => `- ${s}`).join('\n')
  : '- No external test suites for this category'}

### Setup Hints

{props.setupHints && props.setupHints.length > 0
  ? props.setupHints.map(h => `- ${h}`).join('\n')
  : '- No setup hints'}

### Test Directories

{props.testDirs && props.testDirs.length > 0
  ? props.testDirs.map(f => `- ${f}`).join('\n')
  : '- No specific test directories'}

## What To Do

1. Read previous findings for this category in `{props.findingsFile}` (if any)
2. Try the next step to make progress:
   - If tests are **NOT SET UP**: try to create test files and infrastructure
   - If tests are **BLOCKED**: check if the blocker has been resolved since last time
   - If tests are **PARTIALLY SET UP**: try to get more tests running
   - If tests are **RUNNING**: check pass/fail counts, investigate failures
3. Run the relevant test commands
4. Update `{props.findingsFile}` with your findings for this category
5. Commit and push:
```
git add {props.findingsFile}
git commit -m "{props.commitMessage || `📊 test(${props.categoryId}): update integration test findings`}"
git pull --rebase origin main && git push
```

## CRITICAL: Document Blockers

If you can't make progress because a module isn't implemented yet, SAY SO CLEARLY.
Example: "BLOCKED: Cannot test repo creation E2E because repo service is not implemented"

## CRITICAL: Flag Human Intervention

Some blockers can't be solved by agents. Flag these separately as `needsHumanIntervention`:
- "Need Docker running locally"
- "Need PostgreSQL running for integration tests"
- "Need to configure CI secrets"

## Findings File Format

When writing to `{props.findingsFile}`, use this format for your category's section:

```markdown
## {props.categoryId}
### Status: [NOT SET UP | BLOCKED | PARTIALLY SET UP | RUNNING | PASSING]
### What works:
- ...
### What was tried:
- ...
### What's blocked:
- ...
### Needs human intervention:
- ...
### Suggested tickets:
- ...
```

Preserve other categories' sections when updating the file — only modify your own section.
